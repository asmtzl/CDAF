# CDAF(Contrast Detection Auto Focus)

CD.py python code contains contrast detection autofocus algorithm. 
The algorithm calculates the contrast difference between all the contrast pixels over 
the sobel filtered images of the images in order to choose the clearest image among the images shot with different focal lengths,
and chooses the one with the highest contrast difference.
